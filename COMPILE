How To Compile & Run Capstone for Linux, Mac OSX, *nix and Windows
                        *-*-*-*-*-*


Capstone requires no prerequisite packages, so it is easy to compile & install.


(1) On Linux, Mac OSX or *nix:

- To compile for current platform, run either:
		$ ./compile.sh
	or:
		$ make

	Then run "./tests/test*" to see the tests disassembling sample code.

- On 64-bit OS, if you want to cross-compile Capstone for 32-bit binary, run:

	$ ./compile.sh nix32

	Then similarly, run "./tests/test*" to see the tests disassembling sample code.



(2) To install Capstone, run:

	$ sudo make install
	
You are then required to enter root password to copy Capstone into machine
system directories.

NOTE: The core framework that will be installed by "make install" consist of
only following files:

	/usr/include/include/capstone.h
	/usr/include/include/x86.h
	/usr/include/include/arm.h
	/usr/include/include/arm64.h
	/usr/include/include/mips.h
	/usr/lib/libcapstone.so (for Linux/*nix), or /usr/lib/libcapstone.dylib (OSX)



(3) To cross-compile for Windows, Linux & gcc-mingw-w64-i686 (and also gcc-mingw-w64-x86-64
if you want 64-bit binaries) are required.

	- To cross-compile Windows 32-bit binary, simply run
		$ ./compile.sh win32

	- To cross-compile Windows 64-bit binary, simply run
		$ ./compile.sh win64

Resulted files "capstone.dll" and "tests/test*.exe" can then be used on Windows machine.



(4) By default, gcc is used as compiler. If you want to use "clang" instead, compile
the code with:

	$ ./compile clang


(5) So far, Python, Ruby, Ocaml, Java, C# and Go are supported by bindings. Look for the bindings
under directory bindings/, and refer to README file of corresponding languages.
