Capstone is a disassembly framework with the target of becoming the ultimate
disasm engine for binary analysis and reversing in the security community.

Created by Nguyen Anh Quynh, then developed and maintained by a small community,
Capstone offers some unparalleled features:

- Support multiple hardware architectures: ARM, AArch64, Alpha, BPF, Ethereum VM,
  HP PA-RISC (HPPA), M68K, M680X, Mips, MOS65XX, PPC, RISC-V(rv32G/rv64G), SH, Sparc,
  SystemZ, TMS320C64X, TriCore, Webassembly, XCore and X86 (16, 32, 64).

- Having clean/simple/lightweight/intuitive architecture-neutral API.

- Provide details on disassembled instruction (called “decomposer” by others).

- Provide semantics of the disassembled instruction, such as list of implicit
  registers read & written.

- Implemented in pure C language, with lightweight bindings for Swift, D, Clojure, F#,
  Common Lisp, Visual Basic, PHP, PowerShell, Emacs, Haskell, Perl, Python,
  Ruby, C#, NodeJS, Java, GO, C++, OCaml, Lua, Rust, Delphi, Free Pascal & Vala
  ready either in main code, or provided externally by the community).

- Native support for all popular platforms: Windows, Mac OSX, iOS, Android,
  Linux, \*BSD, Solaris, etc.

- Thread-safe by design.

- Special support for embedding into firmware or OS kernel.

- High performance & suitable for malware analysis (capable of handling various
  X86 malware tricks).

- Distributed under the open source BSD license.
