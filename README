Capstone is a disassembly framework with the target of becoming the ultimate
disasm engine for binary analysis and reversing in the security community.

Created by Nguyen Anh Quynh, then developed and maintained by a small community,
Capstone offers some unparalleled features:

- Support multiple hardware architectures: ARM, ARM64 (ARMv8), Mips, PPC & X86.

- Having clean/simple/lightweight/intuitive architecture-neutral API.

- Provide details on disassembled instruction (called “decomposer” by others).

- Provide semantics of the disassembled instruction, such as list of implicit
     registers read & written.

- Implemented in pure C language, with lightweight wrappers for C++, Python,
     Ruby, OCaml, C#, Java and Go available.

- Native support for Windows & *nix platforms (with OSX, Linux, *BSD & Solaris
  have been confirmed).

- Thread-safe by design.

- Distributed under the open source BSD license.

[Compile]

See COMPILE.TXT file for how to compile and install Capstone


[Status]

- Capstone can only compile to Windows via Cygwin, or cross-compile using
MingW. Visual Studio support will be done in the future.

- X86 engine cannot handle many malware tricks yet. Please report all the raw
binary code that Capstone cannot disassemble, or does that wrongly, so we can
fix that in the next version

- This package only contains Java & Python bindings. For C#, Go, Ocaml & Ruby,
refer to the corresponding git repositories.
