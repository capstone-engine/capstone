To compile OCaml bindings, OCaml toolchain is needed. On Ubuntu Linux,
you can install Ocaml with:

    $ sudo apt-get install ocaml opam

To compile OCaml bindings, simply run "opam install ." on the command line.


This directory also contains some test code to show how to use Capstone API.

- test/test_basic.ml
  This code shows the most simple form of API where we only want to get basic
  information out of disassembled instruction, such as address, mnemonic and
  operand string.

- test/test_detail.ml:
  This code shows how to access to architecture-neutral information in disassembled
  instructions, such as implicit registers read/written, or groups of instructions
  that this instruction belong to.

- test/test_<arch>.ml
  These code show how to access architecture-specific information for each
  architecture.
