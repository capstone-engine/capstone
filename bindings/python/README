This directory contains some test code to show how to use Capstone API.

- test.py
  This code shows the most simple form of API where we only want to get basic
  information out of disassembled instruction, such as address, mnemonic and
  operand string.

- test_detail.py:
  This code shows how to access to architecture-neutral information in disassembled
  instructions, such as implicit registers read/written, or groups of instructions
  that this instruction belong to.

- test_<arch>.py
  These code show how to access architecture-specific information for each
  architecture.

To install Python binding on Windows:

Use the Python module installer for 32/64 bit Windows from http://www.capstone-engine.org/download.html

If it fails to locate your Python install, or if you have additional Python installs (e.g. Anaconda / virtualenv)

Run the following command in command prompt:

		C:\> C:\location_to_python\python.exe setup.py install

Copy libcapstone.dll from the 'Core engine for Windows' package available on the same capstone download page and paste it in \location_to_python\Lib\site-packages\capstone\
